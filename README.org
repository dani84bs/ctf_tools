* README
** ctf_tools.sh
This script will try to download the latest version of:
- [[https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/][linpeas]]
- [[https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/][pspy]]
- [[https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/][chisel]]
- [[https://github.com/dani84bs/ctf-web-server/][ctf-web-server]]

After downloading all the tools it will try to run *chisel* and *ctf-web-server.*
- Chisel will be run in reverse server mode on port 9999
- ctf-web server will serve all static files in the www directory

If the script would be run inside a tmux directory it will create new windows
for the tools.
*** Requirements
- Bash
- wget
- python 3
- tmux is not required, but using ctf_tools inside a tmux session will improve
  your experience.
*** Usage
Just download the script, give it execution permissions and launch it, it will
take care of the rest.
